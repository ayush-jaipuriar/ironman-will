Frontend  Master  Protocol  (PRD):  Iron  
Will
 
Version:  1.1  (Expanded)  Status:  Approved  for  Implementation  Scope:  Frontend  Only  (Next.js  14,  Tailwind,  integration  with  Spring  Boot  Backend)  
1.  Design  System  &  Visual  Language  
Philosophy:  The  User  Interface  for  Iron  Will  is  not  a  wrapper;  it  is  a  Command  Interface.  It  rejects  the  soft,  
friendly,
 
dopamine-loop
 
design
 
patterns
 
of
 
modern
 
social
 
media
 
in
 
favor
 
of
 
a
 
stark,
 
utilitarian,
 
and
 
high-stakes
 
aesthetic.
 
The
 
user
 
is
 
operating
 
high-stakes
 
machinery—their
 
own
 
psychology.
 
The
 
interface
 
must
 
feel
 
precise,
 
expensive,
 
and
 
slightly
 
intimidating,
 
like
 
the
 
cockpit
 
of
 
a
 
stealth
 
fighter
 
or
 
the
 
terminal
 
of
 
a
 
bio-research
 
facility.
 
Every
 
interaction
 
should
 
have
 
weight;
 
every
 
click
 
should
 
feel
 
like
 
a
 
decision.
 
1.1  Color  Palette  (Tailwind  Config)  
We  do  not  use  standard  off-the-shelf  colors.  We  define  a  custom  semantic  palette  to  enforce  
the
 
"High-End
 
Biohacker"
 
aesthetic.
 
The
 
goal
 
is
 
to
 
create
 
an
 
environment
 
that
 
feels
 
hermetically
 
sealed
 
and
 
hyper-focused.
 ●  Backgrounds  (The  Void):  ○  bg-void:  #050505  (Main  app  background).  This  is  not  pure  black  (#000),  which  can  
cause
 
smearing
 
on
 
OLEDs,
 
but
 
a
 
deep
 
charcoal
 
that
 
consumes
 
light.
 
It
 
represents
 
the
 
"Focus
 
State."
 ○  bg-card:  #0A0A0A  (Card  surfaces).  A  subtle  elevation  from  the  void,  providing  just  
enough
 
contrast
 
to
 
delineate
 
interactive
 
zones
 
without
 
breaking
 
the
 
immersive
 
darkness.
 ○  bg-overlay:  rgba(0,  0,  0,  0.85)  (Glassmorphism  base).  A  heavy  tint  used  for  modals  
and
 
focus
 
states,
 
blurring
 
out
 
the
 
background
 
to
 
enforce
 
tunnel
 
vision
 
on
 
the
 
active
 
task.
 ●  Primaries  (The  "Energy"):  ○  text-neon-green:  #39FF14  (Success,  Active,  Charging).  This  specific  shade  mimics  
the
 
phosphor
 
of
 
retro-futuristic
 
terminals
 
and
 
radium
 
dials.
 
It
 
signifies
 
"Systems
 
Nominal"
 
and
 
"Willpower
 
Active."
 ○  border-neon-green:  rgba(57,  255,  20,  0.5)  (Glow  effects).  Used  for  active  borders,  
conveying
 
that
 
the
 
component
 
is
 
"powered
 
on."
 ●  Destructive  (The  "Failure"):  ○  text-crimson:  #DC143C  (Error,  Lockout,  Critical).  A  sharp,  aggressive  red  that  triggers  
an
 
immediate
 
"Alert"
 
response
 
in
 
the
 
user's
 
brain.
 ○  bg-crimson-glitch:  rgba(220,  20,  60,  0.15)  (Background  tint).  Used  during  the  lockout  
state
 
to
 
bathe
 
the
 
interface
 
in
 
an
 
emergency
 
light,
 
simulating
 
a
 
containment
 
breach.
 


=== Page 2 ===
●  Typography:  ○  font-sans:  Inter  or  Geist  Sans  (UI  Text).  Chosen  for  maximum  legibility  at  small  sizes  
while
 
maintaining
 
a
 
cold,
 
neutral
 
tone.
 ○  font-mono:  JetBrains  Mono  or  Geist  Mono  (Data,  Scores,  Timestamps).  Monospace  
fonts
 
imply
 
"raw
 
data"
 
and
 
"truth."
 
All
 
metrics—scores,
 
time,
 
dates—must
 
be
 
rendered
 
in
 
mono
 
to
 
reinforce
 
that
 
these
 
are
 
unalterable
 
facts.
 ○  text-ghost:  #888888  (Inactive  labels).  Text  that  recedes  into  the  background,  visible  
only
 
when
 
sought
 
out.
 
1.2  Core  Textures  &  Effects  
●  Glassmorphism  (The  "HUD"):  ○  Standard  Rule:  backdrop-blur-xl  bg-white/5  border  border-white/10.  ○  Application:  Used  for  the  Header,  the  Protocol  Cards,  and  the  Bottom  Navigation  (if  
any).
 
It
 
creates
 
a
 
sense
 
of
 
depth,
 
implying
 
that
 
the
 
data
 
is
 
floating
 
above
 
the
 
void.
 ●  Scanlines  (The  "Terminal"):  ○  A  persistent,  global  CSS  ::before  overlay  with  pointer-events-none.  ○  Implementation:  A  repeating  linear  gradient  (1px  transparent,  1px  black  @  3%  
opacity)
 
combined
 
with
 
a
 
subtle
 
vignette.
 
This
 
gives
 
the
 
entire
 
app
 
a
 
tactile,
 
screen-like
 
texture,
 
reducing
 
the
 
sterility
 
of
 
flat
 
vector
 
graphics.
 ●  The  "Glow"  (Haptic  Light):  ○  Buttons  and  active  inputs  must  utilize  box-shadow:  0  0  15px  rgba(57,  255,  20,  0.3).  ○  Logic:  Interactive  elements  should  appear  to  emit  light.  When  a  user  hovers  or  
focuses
 
on
 
an
 
input,
 
the
 
glow
 
intensity
 
should
 
increase,
 
simulating
 
a
 
surge
 
of
 
power
 
to
 
that
 
component.
 
2.  Page  Specifications  2.1  The  Gateway  (Login  Page)  
Visual  Reference:  "Elite  Access  /  Secure  Terminal"  /  "The  Airlock"  ●  Concept:  This  is  the  transition  point  between  the  chaotic  outside  world  and  the  
disciplined
 
interior
 
of
 
the
 
app.
 
It
 
shouldn't
 
feel
 
like
 
a
 
"Signup
 
Form";
 
it
 
should
 
feel
 
like
 
biometric
 
verification
 
for
 
a
 
vault.
 ●  Layout:  Centered  vertical  stack,  perfectly  balanced.  ●  Background:  bg-void.  ○  Texture:  A  subtle  SVG  Hexagonal  Mesh  pattern  (opacity  5%)  fades  in  from  the  
bottom,
 
suggesting
 
a
 
carbon-fiber
 
reinforced
 
structure.
 ●  Components:  1.  Logo:  "IRON  WILL"  in  font-black  (Heavy  weight),  tracking-widest  (spaced  out).  ■  Animation:  Apply  a  subtle  CSS  skew  and  rgb-shift  animation  on  hover  to  
simulate
 
a
 
digital
 
glitch
 
or
 
signal
 
interference.
 
This
 
establishes
 
the
 
"imperfect/hostile"
 
tech
 
vibe
 
immediately.
 2.  Auth  Button:  


=== Page 3 ===
■  Style:  Pill  shape.  bg-white/10  (Glass).  Border  border-neon-green/30.  ■  Content:  "Sign  in  with  Google"  (White  text).  ■  Interaction:  On  hover,  the  border  turns  solid  border-neon-green,  the  box  
shadow
 
blooms
 
(box-shadow:
 
0
 
0
 
20px
 
...),
 
and
 
the
 
text
 
brightens.
 
It
 
should
 
feel
 
like
 
charging
 
a
 
weapon.
 3.  Footer:  "SYSTEM  STATUS:  ONLINE"  in  text-xs  font-mono  text-neon-green  at  the  
absolute
 
bottom.
 
Include
 
a
 
blinking
 
cursor
 
block
 
_
 
at
 
the
 
end
 
to
 
show
 
the
 
system
 
is
 
live.
 
2.2  The  Dashboard  (HUD)  
Visual  Reference:  "Focus  Mode"  /  "The  Cockpit"  ●  Layout:  A  rigid,  grid-based  layout  (Three-row  Grid:  Header,  Score,  Protocols).  The  user  
should
 
feel
 
like
 
a
 
pilot
 
scanning
 
instruments.
 ●  Zone  A:  The  Header  (Top  10%)  ○  Left:  "IRON  WILL"  (Small  logo,  monochrome).  ○  Right:  Settings  Gear  (Lucide  Icon).  When  clicked,  it  opens  a  mechanical-feeling  
drawer,
 
not
 
a
 
standard
 
modal.
 ●  Zone  B:  The  Score  (Top  40%  -  Dominant)  ○  The  Component:  "Health  Bar"  /  "Willpower  Gauge."  ○  Visual:  A  massive,  screen-spanning  horizontal  progress  bar.  ■  Container:  h-16  bg-gray-900  rounded-none  border  border-gray-800.  Industrial  
look.
 ■  Fill:  bg-neon-green.  Use  a  CSS  linear-gradient  to  give  it  a  "liquid  energy"  look.  
Add
 
an
 
animate-pulse
 
effect
 
to
 
make
 
it
 
look
 
alive.
 ○  Data:  The  Score  (e.g.,  "8.4")  displayed  in  massive  6xl  font-mono  text  centered  over  
the
 
bar
 
(using
 
mix-blend-mode
 
if
 
possible
 
for
 
contrast).
 
This
 
number
 
defines
 
the
 
user's
 
worth
 
in
 
the
 
system.
 ○  The  Avatar:  An  HTML5  Canvas  element  rendering  a  floating  "Wireframe  Sphere"  
(Three.js
 
or
 
pure
 
Canvas).
 ■  Behavior:  It  rotates  slowly  in  idle.  When  the  score  drops,  the  wireframe  turns  red  
and
 
spikes
 
(becomes
 
jagged).
 
When
 
the
 
score
 
is
 
high,
 
it
 
is
 
a
 
perfect,
 
smooth
 
sphere.
 ●  Zone  C:  The  Protocols  (Bottom  50%)  ○  List:  Vertical  scroll  of  "Contract  Cards."  ○  Card  Style:  Minimalist  bg-card.  ■  Left:  Habit  Name  ("Deep  Sleep  Protocol")  in  bold  Sans.  ■  Right:  Status  Badge.  ■  "PENDING":  Hollow  yellow  border,  blinking  text.  ■  "DONE":  Solid  Green  fill,  black  text.  ■  "FAILED":  Solid  Red  fill,  glitch  text.  ○  Action:  Clicking  a  "PENDING"  card  triggers  a  "Drawer  Open"  animation  from  the  
bottom
 
(The
 
Audit
 
Modal).
 


=== Page 4 ===
2.3  The  Contract  (Create  Habit)  
Visual  Reference:  "Negotiation  Phase"  /  "Protocol  Configuration"  ●  Concept:  Not  a  form,  but  a  "configuration  panel."  The  user  is  setting  parameters  for  a  
mission.
 ●  Input  1:  Protocol  Name  ○  Style:  Transparent  background,  border-b  border-gray-700  (No  rounded  boxes).  
Large
 
text-2xl
 
text.
 
The
 
placeholder
 
should
 
be
 
"ENTER
 
PROTOCOL
 
NAME".
 ●  Input  2:  The  Time  Dial  (Custom  Component)  ○  Visual:  Instead  of  a  native  OS  dropdown,  build  a  horizontal  scroll  wheel  (like  a  safe  
dial
 
or
 
an
 
industrial
 
valve).
 ○  Style:  The  numbers  should  be  Monospace.  The  "Selected"  time  is  sandwiched  
between
 
two
 
glowing
 
neon
 
green
 
lines
 
in
 
the
 
center
 
of
 
the
 
screen.
 
Haptic
 
feedback
 
(vibration)
 
should
 
trigger
 
on
 
mobile
 
as
 
numbers
 
tick
 
by.
 ●  Input  3:  Criteria  Builder  ○  Visual:  "Code  Blocks."  ○  Interaction:  User  inputs  criteria  like  "Sleep  Score  >  85".  ○  Feedback:  As  the  user  types,  the  system  auto-formats  the  text  into  a  <code>  block  
styling:
 
[METRIC:
 
Sleep
 
Score]
 
[OPERATOR:
 
>]
 
[VALUE:
 
85].
 
This
 
reinforces
 
that
 
the
 
user
 
is
 
programming
 
a
 
rule,
 
not
 
just
 
making
 
a
 
wish.
 ●  The  Button:  "INITIATE  CONTRACT"  ○  Style:  w-full  bg-neon-green  text-black  font-bold  uppercase  tracking-widest  h-14.  ○  Shape:  Rectangular,  sharp  edges  (0px  border-radius).  It  should  look  like  a  physical  
launch
 
button.
 
2.4  The  Auditor  (Upload  &  Verify)  
Visual  Reference:  "Scanning  Interface"  /  "The  Judgement"  ●  State  1:  Dropzone  ○  A  dashed  border  area  with  a  grid  background.  Text:  "DROP  EVIDENCE  HERE."  ○  Icon:  A  stylized  "Upload"  arrow  that  pulses.  ●  State  2:  Analyzing  (The  "Magic")  ○  Animation:  The  uploaded  image  is  displayed  in  grayscale.  A  "Laser  Line"  (Green  div  
with
 
absolute
 
positioning
 
and
 
a
 
box-shadow
 
glow)
 
moves
 
top-to-bottom
 
over
 
the
 
image
 
repeatedly
 
(high
 
speed).
 ○  Overlay  Text:  "EXTRACTING  METADATA..."  ->  "VERIFYING  TIMESTAMPS..."  ->  
"COMPARING
 
CRITERIA...".
 
Text
 
should
 
appear
 
with
 
a
 
typewriter
 
effect
 
in
 
Monospace
 
font.
 ●  State  3:  Verdict  ○  PASS:  A  massive  rubber-stamp  effect  "APPROVED"  slams  onto  the  screen  (scale  
down
 
animation).
 
Color:
 
Neon
 
Green.
 
Particle
 
effect:
 
Minimalist
 
square
 
confetti
 
falls,
 
signifying
 
data
 
fragment
 
integration.
 ○  FAIL:  A  violent  glitch  effect  shakes  the  entire  screen  viewport.  "REJECTED"  stamp  in  


=== Page 5 ===
Crimson  Red.  The  Agent's  avatar  (the  sphere)  turns  red,  expands,  and  becomes  
jagged/noisy.
 
2.5  The  Lockout  (Game  Over)  
Visual  Reference:  "Hostile  /  Punishment"  /  "Containment  Breach"  ●  Global  Overlay:  z-index:  50.  Covers  the  entire  app,  blocking  all  navigation.  The  user  is  
trapped.
 ●  Background:  Deep  Black  with  bg-crimson-glitch.  A  subtle  red  vignette  pulses  at  the  
edges
 
of
 
the
 
screen
 
like
 
a
 
heartbeat
 
in
 
a
 
horror
 
game.
 ●  Effect:  CSS  Keyframe  animation  shake  applied  to  the  main  container  every  5-10  seconds  
to
 
disorient
 
the
 
user.
 ●  Centerpiece:  ○  Text:  "PROTOCOL  FAILED"  (Stencil  font  /  Military  style).  ○  The  Timer:  A  massive  countdown  to  unlock  (e.g.,  23:59:42).  Font:  Monospace,  Red.  ○  Subtext:  "Accountability  score  critical.  Access  revoked."  ●  Interaction:  All  buttons  are  visually  disabled  (opacity  0.5,  grayscale).  Cursor  set  to  
not-allowed.
 
Clicking
 
anywhere
 
plays
 
a
 
harsh
 
"Access
 
Denied"
 
sound
 
effect
 
(optional,
 
but
 
recommended
 
for
 
PWA).
 
3.  Frontend  Architecture  (Next.js)  3.1  Tech  Stack  Justification  
●  Framework:  Next.js  14  (App  Router) .  Chosen  for  its  robust  routing  and  server-side  
rendering
 
capabilities,
 
ensuring
 
the
 
dashboard
 
loads
 
instantly
 
(crucial
 
for
 
maintaining
 
the
 
"high-performance"
 
feel).
 ●  Styling:  Tailwind  CSS  +  tailwind-merge  +  clsx.  This  combination  allows  for  complex,  
dynamic
 
class
 
logic
 
(e.g.,
 
changing
 
button
 
states
 
based
 
on
 
"Lockout"
 
variables)
 
without
 
messy
 
inline
 
styles.
 ●  State  Management:  Zustand .  We  need  a  global  store  for  the  "User  Score"  and  "Auth  
State"
 
that
 
is
 
lighter
 
than
 
Redux
 
but
 
more
 
capable
 
than
 
Context
 
API.
 
Zustand's
 
atomic
 
updates
 
are
 
perfect
 
for
 
high-frequency
 
UI
 
changes
 
(like
 
the
 
score
 
bar).
 ●  Data  Fetching:  TanStack  Query  (React  Query)  v5 .  Handles  caching,  polling  (for  the  
"Nag"
 
notifications),
 
and
 
optimistic
 
updates
 
(instant
 
feedback
 
on
 
upload
 
before
 
server
 
confirmation).
 ●  Animation:  Framer  Motion .  Standard  CSS  transitions  are  too  linear.  Framer  Motion  
allows
 
us
 
to
 
use
 
"Spring"
 
physics,
 
making
 
the
 
UI
 
feel
 
heavy,
 
mechanical,
 
and
 
reactive,
 
fitting
 
the
 
Biohacker
 
theme.
 ●  Icons:  Lucide  React .  Clean,  vector-based  icons  that  fit  the  minimalist  aesthetic.  ●  3D/Canvas:  React  Three  Fiber  (or  raw  Canvas  API).  Needed  for  the  "Living  Avatar"  
sphere.
